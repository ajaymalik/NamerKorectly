# NamerKorectly

## Introduction
The purpose behind this contract dApp is to develop a blockchain based system to let individuals correctly spell and pronounce your name. This is essential for people with long or complex names, for example Shrishti Mallikarjunaiah could be wrongly understood as Sristi Malikarjuni, and might exhibit confusion on call, such as for making online appointments.

## The Solution
Develop a blockchain based solution to let people easily understand your name, so that they can write and pronounce it correctly. Since Names are immutable but repetitive, a blockchain system makes sense. This will also eliminate delusions among people having common names, to clearly direct to Namer Korectly dApp, which would have a token connected to user's name and each user/address can have a unique token. The end user, such as online customer care personnel, can open the dAPp and enter your token to fetch the correct block holding your Name info such as
• First Name
• Middle Name
• Family Name
• Image stored on IPFS
